# Relaxr Landing Page: Part 2

Now that you spent last night laying out the content for Relaxr's Landing Page, tonight you will go through and style your HTML to look like the design comp. The designer provided a design_file.txt that has font styles and colors to be used in your CSS. If you'd like to continue working off your own `index.html` from last night, feel free to do so. Otherwise there is a finished `index.html` with the addition of classes and ids to help with your styling in the `starter_code`. 

In `starter_code/css` there is an empty `style.css` file for you to add your custom styles. We have also provided you with a `reset.css` that has already been linked in the provided `index.html`. Remember, reset files and normalize files help with styling across browsers to get rid of any inconsistencies so your custom stylesheet should be linked after it.

Hints:
- Be sure to include the google fonts link from the design_file.txt in your HTML `<head>` as well as a link to your custom styles sheet


Bonus:
- add hover effects to buttons and social media icons
